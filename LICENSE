## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all the rights granted you here.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software to do everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for any permitted purpose. However, you may only do so subject to this license. Specifically, the license permits you to:

- Reproduce the software, in whole or in part, for purposes of using, studying, and testing
- Prepare modifications and derivative works based on the software
- Share exact copies of the software
- Share modifications and derivative works of the software, provided that such modifications and derivative works are offered under this same license

## Noncommercial Restriction

In addition to the restrictions in other sections of these terms:

- You may not provide the software to others as a service, whether on a fee basis or otherwise
- You may not sell copies or modified versions of the software
- You may not use the software or copies of the software to provide a service to others
- You may not use the software to offer any service as a contractor, consultant, or agency for any third party

For the purposes of this restriction, "service" means work that involves the use of the software or modifications to it for commercial purposes, including customization of the software for commercial purposes.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers patent claims the licensor can license or becomes able to license, that are necessarily infringed by the software standing alone.

## Disclaimers

The software comes as is. The licensor gives you no other warranties about the software. Except for those warranties the licensor is required to give by law, the licensor disclaims all warranties you might have about the software.

## Limit on Liability

Except as required by applicable law, the licensor will not be liable to you on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including any general, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of these terms or the use of or inability to use the software.
